    <p>Speech is human vocal communication using language. Each language uses phonetic combinations of vowel and
        consonant sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French
        words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic
        character as words in the lexicon of a language according to the syntactic constraints that govern lexical
        words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional speech acts, e.g.,
        informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use enunciation, intonation, degrees of loudness,
        tempo, and other non-representational or paralinguistic aspects of vocalization to convey meaning. In their
        speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place
        of origin (through accent), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness),
        psychological states (emotions or moods), physico-psychological states (sobriety or drunkenness, normal
        consciousness and trance states), education or experience, and the like.</p>

           Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people swear they do not
        always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use
        speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do
        something. There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People talk to themselves
        sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the
        use of silent speech in an interior monologue to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary
        adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person. Solo speech can be used
        to memorize or to test one's memorization of things, and in prayer or in meditation (e.g., the use of a mantra).<hr>
